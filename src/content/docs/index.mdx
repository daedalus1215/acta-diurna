## About these docs

This site is a personal engineering playbook.

It captures **patterns, practices, and ways of working** I’ve used across
multiple teams and companies, with an emphasis on clarity, operability,
and long-term maintainability.

The docs are written to be:
- **public-safe by default**
- **company-agnostic**
- **easy to copy and adapt**
- useful as both **reference** and **reminder**

When joining a new team, I typically bring these patterns with me and tailor
them to the local context.

## How to use this site

These docs are not meant to be read linearly.

If you’re:
- 🧭 **New to a team** → start with [Onboarding](./20-onboarding/)
- 🏗️ **Trying to understand a system** → see [Architecture](./30-architecture/)
- 🚨 **Dealing with production issues** → see [Operability](./40-operability/)
- ✍️ **Making or reviewing decisions** → see [Decisions (ADRs)](./60-decisions/)
- 🔎 **Looking for specifics** → see [Reference](./90-reference/)

## What you’ll find here

- **Playbook**  
  How I approach engineering work: collaboration, reviews, releases,
  incidents, and tradeoffs.

- **Onboarding**  
  How I help new engineers get productive quickly and safely.

- **Architecture**  
  How I think about systems, boundaries, and change over time.

- **Operability**  
  Runbooks, monitoring philosophy, and incident response patterns.

- **How-tos**  
  Task-focused guides designed to be adapted across teams.

- **Decisions (ADRs)**  
  Lightweight records explaining *why* certain approaches were chosen.

- **Reference**  
  Commands, checklists, and short reminders I don’t want to relearn.

## Philosophy

A few guiding principles behind these docs:

- Optimize for **future readers who are tired**
- Prefer **clear defaults** over clever solutions
- Separate **patterns** from **implementations**
- Write docs that survive **team and company changes**
- Treat documentation as part of the system, not an afterthought

---

## Portability note

These docs intentionally avoid:
- company names
- proprietary details
- internal URLs
- hard-coded service identifiers

Company-specific details are best added as a **thin overlay** when adapting
these docs to a particular environment.

## Maintenance

These docs evolve over time.

If something is unclear, incomplete, or outdated, the fix is to improve the
doc—not to rely on memory or tribal knowledge.
