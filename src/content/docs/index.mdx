## About

This is my personal scratchpad—quick notes, explanations, patterns, and references I’ve written for myself.

Mainly so I can find things fast when I need them again (from past discussions, meeting prep, or recurring ideas).

Everything here is company-agnostic, public-safe, and written for quick retrieval.

I might share a link occasionally, but this is mostly for me.

## Guiding Ideas

- Write for fast lookup (especially when tired)  
- Keep it clear and direct  
- Separate patterns from specific implementations  
- Stay portable across teams and companies

## Notes

These notes grow as needed. If something’s unclear or outdated, I’ll fix it.

(If you’re here from a shared link—hi! Take whatever’s useful.)
