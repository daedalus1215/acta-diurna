This glossary defines the patterns used at each layer of the system and the dependency rules that govern them.

## Patterns to Expect in the Application Layer

- Actions (single-route controllers)
- Responders (DTO shaping)
- Listeners (event entry points)
- Webhooks (external HTTP entry points)
- API contracts and validation

## Patterns to Expect in the Domain Layer

- Domain Services (orchestration)
- Aggregators (via ports)
- Transaction Scripts (business rules + param owners)
- Mappers (coordinate assembly)
- Assemblers (compose data)
- Converters (pure transforms)
- Entities and value objects

## Patterns to Expect in the Infrastructure Layer

- Repositories (return entities or projections, never DTOs)
- External IO adapters
- Dispatchers (publish domain events)
- Remote Callers (send commands to other systems)

## Design Goals

- Keep type ownership local
- Prevent shared-type dumping grounds
- Ensure dependencies point inward
- Make circular dependencies structurally impossible
- Keep controllers SRP-compliant by refactoring methods into single-purpose Action classes
